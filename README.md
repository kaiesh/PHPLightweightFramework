#PHP Lightweight Framework
###A quick way to kickstart a small PHP/MySQL application

**Purpose**
These files are intended to help speedy deployment of PHP web applications that need to interact with a MySQL database, and manipulate records as objects.

It contains a debugging framework (that prints to screen or file), and a logging framework so that you can easily measure performance.

The current version does not support very complicated database objects (e.g. database records with multiple primary keys) but this can be easily updated by using array inputs in the DatabaseObject.php file.
